# About

Jack's Gym is a state-of-the-art fitness center dedicated to helping individuals achieve their health and fitness goals. Our mission is to provide a supportive and motivating environment where members can improve their physical well-being, boost confidence, and lead healthier lifestyles. 

# Designs
__Surface__

I have used a dark colour background to match the images. The overlays and text were more vibrant to make it stand out. This was a nice contrasting pair that made the overlay on the head bold. This also made the timetable, health benefits stand out much more too. This will help with Accessibility for visually impaired users.

These colours feature throughout all the pages to keep consistency.


# Features



__Navigation Bar__

- Features that are displayed at the top of the page on all three pages. The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Gallery, and Sign Up page. This is easy to navigate as its identical on all pages.
- The section will allow users to navigate easily from page to page across all devices without having to hit the 'back' button to revert to the previous page.
